Sendgrid API test Readme

To run the program run the command "lettuce" in the sendgrid_api directory

Problems that I went through
   Somehow selenium could not find any element inside the API workshop method.
   I tried everything to find the element using every single variation of the find_element_by_... method 
   but nothing worked. I used xpath, I tried chromewebdriver, I automated logging into sendgrid website before going to
   the api workshop page hoping that it was a permission problem but that failed also.
   I suspect that it maybe my virtual machine is messed up because to finish my cucumber code test I had to spend many many hours
   trying to get the thing to compile and run without dependency errors.
   If I had more time I would have verified filling out all forms by parsing through the api call and check if all the parameters exist in the call
